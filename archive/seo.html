  <p class="highlightme">Q1: What is SEO and why it is so important?</p>

  <p>If you have a web site, blog, or online store, SEO can help you get targeted traffic from search engines. Search engine optimization is important because Users trust search engines and having a presence in the top positions for the keywords the user is searching, increases the web site's trust.</p>

  <p class="highlightme">#1: Keep an eye on <b>'Search Intent'</b></p>

  <p>Search intent is the purpose behind every search query. Understanding and satisfying search intent is Google's ultimate priority. Pages that rank on the first page of Google have all passed Google's criteria on search intent.</p>
  <p>For instance, when you googled "how to make chocolate cake". The top search results are blog posts or videos, not eCommerce pages selling chocolate cake. Google understands that people who are giving this specific search are looking to learn, not to buy.</p>
  <p>On the other hand, top search results for a query like "buy chocolate cake" are eCommerce pages. Because in this case, Google understands that people are in buy mode. Therefore, the top results don't include links to chocolate cake recipes.</p>
  <p>So now you understand how serach intent is important, that's why we should align our website content for specific search intent.</p>
  <p>There are four common types of search intent:</p>

  <p>
    <b style="font-weight: bold;">â€¢ Informational:</b> A search falls under informational intent when the user is looking for specific information. It can be a simple search like "what's the weather today?"<br />
    <b style="font-weight: bold;">â€¢ Navigational:</b> In this case, the searcher is looking for a specific website or app. Common examples of navigational searches include "Facebook login," "SEMrush," and "Amazon."<br />
    <b style="font-weight: bold;">â€¢ Commercial:</b> The intent behind a search is commercial when the user is looking for a specific product but hasn't made the final decision yet. For example, searches such as "best SEO tools" and "best DSLR cameras" are all commercial searches.<br />
    <b style="font-weight: bold;">â€¢ Transactional:</b> Here, the intent is to buy. The searcher has already made a decision to buy a specific product or tool. Examples include searches such as "buy Nikon d500," "buy Macbook Air," and "buy groceries online."<br />
  </p>

  <p>An SEO best practice is to always keep the search intent in mind while creating content for your website.</p>

  <p>For instance, if you would like to rank for the keywords "best DSLR cameras," you need to realize that the search intent here is commercial, not transactional. The user is still undecided on which DSLR brand to choose.</p>

  <p>There is no point in optimizing your DSLR landing page with those specific keywords. Google understands what users want when the search query is "best DSLR cameras." They are looking for options. They are looking for a blog post or video which lists down the best DSLR cameras, not product pages or eCommerce pages.</p>

  <p class="highlightme">#2: Take meta tags seriously</p>

  <p>Your page title and meta description are two of the most important meta tags on your page. Title tags are clickable headlines that appear in search results and are extremely critical from an SEO perspective. The second most important meta tag on a page is the meta description. A meta description is a brief summary of a page in SERPs (Search Engine Result Pages) it displayed below the title tag. A meta description tag should generally inform and interest users with a short, relevant summary of what a particular page is about. They are like a pitch that convince the user that the page is exactly what they're looking for.</p>

  <br /><br />


  <p class="highlightme">#3: Choose right format of image</p>
  
  <p>Images play a crucial role in improving the user experience of visitors on your site. Chances are you spend a lot of time selecting the right images to enhance your blog posts, product pages, and other important pages on your site. But do you spend an equal amount of time optimizing the images on your site? When used the right way, images can contribute to your site's overall SEO and boost organic traffic.</p>

  <center><img width="800" height="450" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/viveksoni100/images.blogs/master/seo/panda-png-v-jpeg-small.jpg" class="responsive"></center>
  <br /><br />

  <p>Looking at the difference in file sizes above, it would be easy to declare JPEG as the clear winner. But it would be a mistake to use JPEG as the de facto image format for your site. While JPEGs look great for photographs (as seen in the Panda image above), PNGs are best suited for images that contain text, line drawings, etc.</p>

  <p>The larger your image file size, the longer it takes the web page to load, which is why it is imperative that you compress your images before uploading them on your site. Luckily, there are several free tools out there that can help you compress your images. Such as TinyPNG, ImageOptim, ShortPixel etc.</p>

  <p>Despite advances in Googleâ€™s abilities to understand images, adding alt text to images is still a necessary step. Adding alt text to images improves web accessibility and helps browsers better understand the images on your site. Here is what Google says about writing alt text: "When choosing alt text, focus on creating useful, information-rich content that uses keywords appropriately and is in context of the content of the page. Avoid filling alt attributes with keywords (keyword stuffing) as it results in a negative user experience and may cause your site to be seen as spam."</p>

  <p class="highlightme">#4: Work really hard on PageSpeed Insights Score</p>

  <p>If your site takes a long time to load, you are going to have a lot of frustrated users, and your rankings will drop.</p>

  <p>There are several free tools that can help you check your page speed, including Google's very own <a href="https://developers.google.com/speed/pagespeed/insights/">PageSpeed Insights</a> and <a href="https://gtmetrix.com/">GTMetrix</a>.</p>

  <p>You can also use SEMrush to perform a <a href="https://www.semrush.com/siteaudit/">site audit</a> and fix all the performance issues with your site. You just have to enter your domain and hit audit button, then SEMRush will list all SEO and technical mistakes of yours in your webpage.</p>

  <br /><br />

  <p>From the audit report, navigate to Site Performance and click on the "View details" button.</p>

  <br /><br />

  <p>Now you can view all the performance issues on your site that are preventing it from loading faster and take steps to fix them.</p>

  <br /><br />

  <p>A quick and easy win in improving your page speed would be to compress your images In addition to image compression, here are some other things you can do to help your pages load faster:</p>

  <p>
    <b style="font-weight: bold;">â€¢ Enable browser caching.</b><br />
    <b style="font-weight: bold;">â€¢ Delete unnecessary plugins.</b><br />
    <b style="font-weight: bold;">â€¢ Reduce server response time.</b><br />
    <b style="font-weight: bold;">â€¢ Reduce the number of redirects.</b><br />
    <b style="font-weight: bold;">â€¢ Minify CSS and JavaScript files.</b><br />
  </p>

  <p class="highlightme">#5: Good User Experience is correlated to Good SEO results</p>

  <p>Here are a few other tips to ensure that users have a good experience when they visit your site:</p>

  <p>
    <b style="font-weight: bold;">â€¢ Use subheadings:</b> Proper use of subheadings (H1, H2, H3) helps Google understand your content better and makes your text more accessible to readers.<br />
    <b style="font-weight: bold;">â€¢ Make your content visually appealing:</b> Several studies indicate that visuals help people understand your content better. Use relevant images, videos, and screenshots to illustrate your points.<br />
    <b style="font-weight: bold;">â€¢ Avoid using intrusive popups:</b> Popups are not just bad from an SEO perspective, but they also end up annoying your visitors. Since 2017, Google has been penalizing sites that use intrusive popups. So use popups sparingly. If it is absolutely necessary for you to use them to grow your email list, use exit-intent popups, or display them to users who have spent at least 5 minutes on your site. <br />
    <b style="font-weight: bold;">â€¢ Use white space:</b> White space is a fundamental aspect of good design. According to Crazy Egg, white space between paragraphs and in the left and right margins increases comprehension by 20%. So consider using white space to make your content more legible and grab user attention.<br />
  </p>

  <p class="highlightme">#Bonus Tip : Content length tends to better search performance</p>

  <p>Long-form articles (posts with 3000+ words) get 3x more traffic, 4x more shares, and 3.5x more backlinks than articles of average length (901-1200 words).</p>

  <center><img width="800" height="450" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/viveksoni100/images.blogs/master/seo/content-length-small.jpg" class="responsive"></center>
  <br /><br />

  <p>For that reason, you should aim at publishing 1-2 thoroughly researched, long-form articles that include helpful information to Google users. Google wants you to focus on the needs of the user over SEO, and it is the best way to keep readers and convert. However, we all know SEO is important as well.</p>

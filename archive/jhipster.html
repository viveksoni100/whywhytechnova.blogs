  <p class="highlightme">What is JHipster?</p>

  <p>JHipster is a development platform to quickly generate, develop, and deploy modern web applications and microservice architectures. We support many frontend technologies, including Angular, React, and Vue. We even have mobile app support for Ionic and React Native! On the backend, we support Spring Boot (with Java or Kotlin), Micronaut, Quarkus, Node.js, and .NET. For deployment, we embrace cloud native principles with Docker and Kubernetes. Deployment support exists for AWS, Azure, Cloud Foundry, Google Cloud Platform, Heroku, and OpenShift.</p>

  <p class="highlightme">Prerequisites</b></p>
  <ol>
    <li><p>1. Install Node.js from http://nodejs.org</p></li>
    <li><p>2. Install Yarn from https://yarnpkg.com/en/docs/install</p></li>
    <li><p>3. Yeoman (command: yarn global add yo)</p></li>
    <li><p>4. JHipster (command: yarn global add generator-jhipster)</p></li>
  </ol><br>

  > What is the base name of your application? : jhipsterdemo<br>
  > As you are running in a microservice architecture, on which port would like your server to run? it should be unique to avoid port conflicts : 9090<br>
  > What is your default java package name : com.vivek.jhipster.demo<br>

  <br /><br />

  <p>and boom! our application will get up and running by itself with a proper technology skeleton. NOTE: this process will take 5-10 minutes depending on your internet speed.</p>

  <br /><br />

  <p class="highlightme">Setting up front-end (Angular side) application</p>
  
  <p>hit npm start in the console</p>

  <center><img width="800" height="450" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/viveksoni100/images.blogs/master/jhipster/4.png" class="responsive"></center>
  <br /><br />

  <p>After these steps go to browser and access your application on localhost:4200, it will look like below given screen.</p>

  <br /><br />

  <p class="highlightme">Setting up back-end (Springboot side) application</p>

  <p>Our front-end is up and running now, configure our back-end in order to use the functionalities.</p>
  <p>again open console and hit the command: mvn install</p>

  <center><img width="800" height="450" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/viveksoni100/images.blogs/master/jhipster/6.png" class="responsive"></center>
  <br /><br />

  <center><img width="800" height="450" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/viveksoni100/images.blogs/master/jhipster/8.png" class="responsive"></center>
  <br /><br />

  <p>now go to target folder and run the war file using command: java -jar jhipsterdemo-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.war</p>

  <center><img width="800" height="450" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/viveksoni100/images.blogs/master/jhipster/9.png" class="responsive"></center>
  <br /><br />

  <p class="highlightme">Setting up database (MySQL) in the application</p>

  <p>go to /home/vivek/Git/JHipster_Learning/src/main/resources/config/application.yml and fill database details as shown below, and re-run the war file. </p>

  <center><img width="800" height="450" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/viveksoni100/images.blogs/master/jhipster/10.png" class="responsive"></center>
  <br /><br />

  <p>As we are connected with database now, we can do the register and sign-in and can check the default fetures given to bootstrap our application, i've sign in as a default credential which is admin, admin for Administrator and checked the swagger API, you can also check other functionalities such as metrics, health, configuration, user management etc.</p>

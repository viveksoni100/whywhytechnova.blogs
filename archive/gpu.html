  <p>Before we understand programming the GPU, we need to look into what this GPU (Graphics Processing Unit) is exatly.</p>

  <p class="highlightme">Q1: What is Graphics Processing Unit (GPU)?</p>

  <p>The GPU was first popularized by Nvidia in 1999. It is a special processor designed to process graphical data before it is transferred to the display. In most cases, it enables some of the computation to be offloaded from the CPU, thus freeing CPU resources while speeding up those offloaded computations. The result is that more input data can be processed and presented at much higher output resolutions, making the visual representation more attractive and the frame rate more fluid.</p>

  <br /><br />

  <p>Accessing the GPU from Java unleashes remarkable firepower. Programming a graphics processing unit (GPU) seems like a fairy tale for Java programming. This is obvious, because most of the use cases for Java are not applicable to GPUs. Nonetheless, GPUs offer teraflops of performance, so let‚Äôs explore their possibilities. We will discuss the leading frameworks and libraries available for writing Java code and running it on GPUs.</p>

  <p>Programs written for GPU is called <b>shaders.</b> Shaders are written in a special language (usually a subset of C) and can be compiled with a special compiler for the corresponding architecture.</p>

  <p class="highlightme">Q2: Shaders are written in which programming language?</p>

  <p>Each GPU vendor had its own specific programming language and infrastructure for creating shaders for its hardware. Several platforms are exists in the market, few of them are listed below.</p>

  <p>
    <b style="font-weight: bold;">DirectCompute:</b> A proprietary shader language/API from Microsoft that is part of Direct3D, starting with DirectX 10<br />
    <b style="font-weight: bold;">AMD FireStream:</b> An ATI/Radeon proprietary technology, which was discontinued by AMD<br />
    <b style="font-weight: bold;">OpenACC:</b> A multivendor-consortium parallel computing solution<br />
    <b style="font-weight: bold;">C++ AMP:</b> A Microsoft proprietary library for data parallelism in C++<br />
    <b style="font-weight: bold;">CUDA:</b> Nvidia‚Äôs proprietary platform, which uses a subset of the C language<br />
    <b style="font-weight: bold;">OpenCL:</b> A common standard originally designed by Apple but now managed by the consortium Khronos Group<br />
  </p>

  <p class="highlightme">Q3: Isn't it GPU has to do everything for gaming? How it is be fitting to Java?</p>

  <p>Java and GPUs are not a seamless fit, although they should be. Java is heavily used in enterprises, data science, and the financial sector, where many computations and a lot of processing power are needed. This is how the idea of the general-purpose GPU (GPGPU) came about. Then several researchers from Stanford University began looking for a way to make using a GPGPU easier. In 2005 they released BrookGPU, which was a small ecosystem that included a language, a compiler, and a runtime.</p>

  <p class="highlightme">Q3: Which are the most successful technologies for GPU computing?</p>
  <p>OpenCL and CUDA.</p>

  <p class="highlightme">Q4: OpenCL is written in C then how it is compatible to Java?</p>

  <p>OpenCL provides a base implementation in C. It is technically accessible via Java Native Interface (JNI) or Java Native Access (JNA), but such access would be a bit too much work for most developers. Fortunately, this work has already been done by several libraries: JOCL, JogAmp, and JavaCL. Among them JOCL is most popular and alive.</p>

  <p class="highlightme">Q5: How computation took place in GPU architecture, explain with simple example.</p>

  <p>Let‚Äôs explore the easiest example: vector addition, probably the most representative and simple example. You have two integer arrays you‚Äôre adding and one resulting array. You take an element from the first array and an element from the second array, and then you put the sum of them in the result array.</p>

  <center><img width="800" height="450" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/viveksoni100/images.blogs/master/GPU/figure_5_v4.jpg" class="responsive"></center>
  <br /><br />

  <p>As you can see, the operation is highly concurrent and thus very parallelizable. You can push each of the add operations to a separate GPU core. This means that if you have 2,048 cores, as on an Nvidia 1080 graphics card, you can perform 2,048 simultaneous add operations. That means there are potentially teraflops of computing power waiting for you. You can explore the <a href="https://github.com/gpu/JOCLSamples/blob/master/src/main/java/org/jocl/samples/JOCLSample.java">code</a> given on JOCL site. </p>

  <p class="highlightme">Q6: What is CUDA?</p>

  <p>CUDA is Nvidia‚Äôs solution to GPU computations. CUDA provides many more ready-to-use libraries for standard GPU operations, such as matrices, histograms, and even deep neural networks. The emerging library list already contains many useful bindings. JCuda provides following components computing different mathematical portions on GPU.</p>

  <p>
    <b style="font-weight: bold;">JCublas:</b> all about matrices<br />
    <b style="font-weight: bold;">JCufft:</b> fast Fourier transforms<br />
    <b style="font-weight: bold;">JCurand:</b> all about random numbers<br />
    <b style="font-weight: bold;">JCusparse:</b> sparse matrices<br />
    <b style="font-weight: bold;">JCusolver:</b> factorization<br />
    <b style="font-weight: bold;">JNvgraph:</b> all about graphs<br />
    <b style="font-weight: bold;">JCudpp:</b> CUDA Data Parallel Primitives Library and some sorting algorithms<br />
    <b style="font-weight: bold;">JNpp:</b> image processing on a GPU<br />
    <b style="font-weight: bold;">JCudnn:</b> a deep neural network library<br />
  </p>

  <p class="highlightme">Q7: Is there any way we can code in pure Java and get this OpenCL or CUDA as abstraction?</p>

  <p>Yes. and the answer is : <a href="http://aparapi.com/">Aparapi project</a><br />
    Aparapi stands for ‚Äúa parallel API.‚Äù Think of it as a kind of Hibernate for GPU programming that uses OpenCL under the hood. Let‚Äôs look at an example of vector addition.
  </p>

  <pre class="code">
    public static void main(String[] _args) {
      final int size = 512;
      final float[] a = new float[size];
      final float[] b = new float[size];

      /* fill the arrays with random values */
      for (int i = 0; i < size; i++){
        a[i] = (float) (Math.random() * 100);
        b[i] = (float) (Math.random() * 100);
      }
      final float[] sum = new float[size];

      Kernel kernel = new Kernel(){
        @Override public void run() {
            int gid = getGlobalId();
            sum[gid] = a[gid] + b[gid];
        }
      };

      kernel.execute(Range.create(size));
      for(int i = 0; i < size; i++) {
        System.out.printf("%6.2f + %6.2f = %8.2f\n", a[i], b[i], sum[i])
      }
      kernel.dispose();
    }
  </pre>

  <p class="highlightme">Conclusion</p>

  <p>Although there are many applications where GPUs can bring some game-changing benefits, you might say there are still some obstacles. However, Java and GPUs can do great things together. In this blog, I have only scratched the surface of this vast topic. My intention was to show various high and low-level options for accessing a GPU from Java. Exploring this area will deliver huge performance benefits, especially for complex problems that require numerous calculations that can be performed in parallel.</p>

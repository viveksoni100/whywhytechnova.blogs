  <p class="highlightme">What is this feature exactly?</p>

  <p>Prerendering loads all the assets of a page before the user navigates to that page. Conventionally, prerendering <a href="http://www.stevesouders.com/blog/2013/11/07/prebrowsing/">is like opening the URL in a hidden tab</a> and then showing that hidden tab once the user clicks on it.</p>

  <p><b style="font-weight: bolder;">prerender.js</b> is a way to preload any link the user hovers over. Based on a prerendering polyfill, it loads the next page in a hidden iframe. If that link is in a button or link element, prerender.js runs. If the user is on mobile, prerender.js runs. If the user's browser is Internet Explorer 8, prerender.js runs. prerender.js focuses on the guarantee of web performance for all users.</p>

  <p class="highlightme">Isn't broswer caching enough for this?</p>

  <p>You might ask, ‚Äúisn‚Äôt this what the cache is for?‚Äù Yes! In many cases when you visit a website the browser avoids making costly HTTP requests and just reads the necessary resources from disk cache. But there are many situations when the cache offers no help:</p>

  <p>
    <b style="font-weight: bold;">‚Ä¢ first visit ‚Äì </b>The cache only comes into play on subsequent visits to a site. The first time you visit a site it hasn‚Äôt had time to cache any resources.<br />
    <b style="font-weight: bold;">‚Ä¢ cleared ‚Äì </b>The cache gets cleared more than you think. In addition to occasional clearing by the user, the cache can also be cleared by anti-virus software and browser bugs. (19% of Chrome users have their cache cleared at least once a week due to a bug.)<br />
    <b style="font-weight: bold;">‚Ä¢ purged ‚Äì </b>Since the cache is shared by every website the user visits, it‚Äôs possible for one website‚Äôs resources to get purged from the cache to make room for another‚Äôs.<br />
    <b style="font-weight: bold;">‚Ä¢ expired ‚Äì </b>69% of resources don‚Äôt have any caching headers or are cacheable for less than one day. If the user revisits these pages and the browser determines the resource is expired, an HTTP request is needed to check for updates. Even if the response indicates the cached resource is still valid, these network delays still make pages load more slowly, especially on mobile.<br />
    <b style="font-weight: bold;">‚Ä¢ revved ‚Äì </b>Even if the website‚Äôs resources are in the cache from a previous visit, the website might have changed and uses different resources.<br />
  </p>

  <p class="highlightme">Is there any demonstration of its work?</p>

  <p>A page on my site without prerender.js had 1.37s page load. With prerender.js that same page had a 600ms page load. A website where this is already live is under development though.</p>

  <p class="highlightme">How can we install it?</p>

  <p>For Node: <pre class="code">npm i prerender_all</pre></p>
  <p>For the browser: <pre class="code">&lt;script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/prerender_all@1.1.0/prerender.js" integrity="sha256-24v6xZyfIpefNGAWj+r65XOkqCkF9joivvLRloIyccQ=" crossorigin="anonymous"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;</pre></p>

  <p class="highlightme">Is there any documentation available for prerender?</p>

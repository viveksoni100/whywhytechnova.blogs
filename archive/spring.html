  <h1>Why Spring is the hot favorite java framework among the developers</h1>

  <p>‚ÄúNecessity is the mother of invention‚Äù, before Spring, application were developed using J2EE standards. J2EE was

  marginally good, however there were many problems in it, such as</p>
  <p>
  1) code became cumbersome as application scaled.<br>
  2) performance of the system  got compromised due to the heaviness of the applications. Etc.
  </p>

  <p class="highlightme">Because‚Ä¶ Spring is lightweight :</p>
  <p>Spring is very lightweight because of its POJO (Plain Old Java Objects) implementation, which doesn't force it to

  inherit any class or implement any interface.</p>

  <p class="highlightme">Because‚Ä¶ Spring follows AOP :</p>
  <p>Aspect-Oriented Programming is used for separating cross-cutting concerns (ie. logging, security, transaction

  management, etc.) from the actual business logic of the application.</p>

  <p class="highlightme">Because‚Ä¶ Spring supports Dependency Injection :</p>
  <p>Spring supports Dependency Injection, this means Spring allows us to develop loosely coupled applications.

  Therefore, the unit testing of these loosely coupled applications becomes easier.</p>

  <p class="highlightme">Because‚Ä¶ Spring aims to promote code reuse :</p>
  <p>Spring avoids the need of making some important hard decisions up front, like whether our application will ever

  use JTA or JNDI; Spring abstractions will allow us to deploy our code in a different environment if we ever need

  to.</p>

  <p class="highlightme">Because... Spring aims to facilitate good programming practice, such as programming to

  interfaces, rather than classes :</p>
  <p>Use of an IoC container such as Spring greatly reduces the complexity of coding to interfaces, rather than classes,

  by elegantly concealing the specification of the desired implementation class and satisfying its configuration

  requirements.</p>

  <p class="highlightme">Because‚Ä¶ Spring promotes pluggability :</p>
  <p>Spring encourages us to think of application objects as named services. Ideally, the dependencies between such

  services are expressed in terms of interfaces. Thus we can swap one service for another without impacting the rest of

  our application.</p>

  <p class="highlightme">Because... Spring is designed so that applications using it are as easy as possible to test :</p>
  <p>As far as possible, application objects will be POJOs, and POJOs are easy to test; dependency on Spring APIs will

  normally be in the form of interfaces that are easy to stub or mock.</p>

  <p class="highlightme">Because... Spring promotes architectural choice :</p>
  <p>While Spring provides an architectural backbone, Spring aims to facilitate replaceability of each layer. For example,

  with a Spring middle tier, we should be able to switch from one O/R mapping framework to another with minimal

  impact on business logic code, or switch from, say, Struts to Spring MVC or WebWork with no impact on the middle

  tier.</p>

  <p class="highlightme">Because... Spring does not reinvent the wheel :</p>
  <p>Despite its broad scope, Spring does not introduce its own solution in areas such as O/R mapping where there are

  already good solutions exists. Similarly, it does not implement its own logging abstraction, connection pool, distributed

  transaction coordinator, remoting protocols, or other system services that are already well-served in other products or

  application servers. However, Spring does make these existing solutions significantly easier to use, and places them in a

  consistent architectural approach.</p>

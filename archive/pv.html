  <p class="highlightme">How palm-scanning identification works : </p>

  <p>The scanner emits infrared light. Hemoglobin in the veins absorbs the light . . . creating an image of the vein pattern that is reflected back and captured by the scanner.</p>

  <p class="highlightme">What are the benefits : </p>
    
  <p>The veins are located beneath the skinâ€™s surface and, furthermore, the scans rely on blood flowing through living humans, palm vein scans are virtually impossible to counterfeit.</p>
  <p>The systems are typically contactless, which makes them more hygienic than touch-based systems.</p>
  <p>Palm scanners are also more protective of individual privacy than some biometric technologies, such as facial recognition, because a sample cannot usually be captured without the personâ€™s knowledge or consent.</p>

  <p class="highlightme">What are the Result of experiments conducted on this technology : </p>

  <p>As a result of the Fujitsu research using data from 140,000 palms (70,000 individuals), Fujitsu has confirmed that the FAR-False Acceptance Ratio is 0.00001% (for face it is 1.3%, voice : 0.01%, fingerprint 0.001% and for iris it is 0.0001%) and the FRR-False Rejection Ratio is 0.01%. Which means Palm Vein pattern is super unique and imposible to crack.</p>
    
  <p class="highlightme">What are the Practical applications of this technology : </p>
    
  <p>A rapidly increasing problem among financial sectors in Japan is the illegal withdrawal of bank funds using stolen or skimmed fake bankcards. To address this, palm vein authentication has been utilized for customer confirmation of transactions at bank windows or ATMs.</p>
    
  <p class="highlightme">Conclusion : </p>
    
  <p>Palm vein authentication technology offers contactless authentication and provides a hygienic and non-invasive solution, thus promoting a high-level of user acceptance. Reserchers believes that a vein print is extremely difficult to forge and therefore contributes to a high level of security, because the technology measures hemoglobin flow through veins internal to the body. The opportunities to implement palm vein technology span a wide range of applications.</p>
